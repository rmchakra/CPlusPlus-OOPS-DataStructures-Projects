? tile has been implemented differently from given scrabble game such that it would be entered while the letters are being placed by the program rather than as a term following during the input

Unused variable result will be used in future implementation hence produces a warning

memory leaks occur causing errors which is traced back to file bag which I am not allowed to edit

Program does not segfault on my vm however the submission check seg faults it. Please verify code on vm.
