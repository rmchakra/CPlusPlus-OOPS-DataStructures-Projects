Message with which to commit will be requested. After the command is given with an appropriate message using -m "message" , it commits the staged files before pushing them onto github 

Problem 4

end output :-
in = {1, 1, 1, 1, 1}

Logic :
at each recursion, when the code enters funcB the 0th element (1) is stored in the temp variable. This is then iteratively swapped with increasing element numbers for i starting with a swap of itself, then the first element, then the second and so on until the fifth. After each swap, the original 0th element i.e. 1 replaces what is curently there in funcA. Thus this over the program replaces every element with the first element leading to a final outcome of in = {1, 1, 1, 1, 1}
